/**
 * Regression spec for the "delete doesn't animate in month view" bug.
 *
 * Background: when a user deletes an event in month view, the event
 * should fade out over ~180ms (matching the rest of the calendar's
 * subtle enter/exit animations). The bug was that two of the three
 * AnimatePresence wrappers in CalendarGrid.tsx were wrapped in
 * `{dayEvents.length > 0 && ...}` / `{dayTasks.length > 0 && ...}`
 * conditionals. When the LAST event on a day was deleted, the
 * conditional flipped false and the entire <div> (with its
 * AnimatePresence) was unmounted by React before framer-motion could
 * run the exit animation — the card just disappeared.
 *
 * This spec seeds a single event on a day in the current month, then
 * right-clicks → Delete on it in month view, and asserts the motion.div
 * wrapper's computed opacity actually drops below 1 during the exit
 * animation. If the bug recurs, the wrapper is unmounted synchronously
 * and the assertion fails.

/**
 * E2E spec for the monthly recurrence pattern picker (R2.4).
 *
 * Before R2.4, the monthly pattern picker (e.g. "Second Tuesday") was
 * writing its per-BYDAY positional control to a field named `bySetPos`
 * in the form state, which was the wrong destination — `bySetPos` is
 * RFC 5545's standalone positional rule part (e.g. "the last weekday"),
 * not the per-BYDAY ordinal (e.g. "second Tuesday"). The result was
 * that selecting "Second Tuesday" in the UI would round-trip to the
 * server as `BYSETPOS=2;BYDAY=TU`, which most CalDAV servers interpret
 * as a meaningless or no-op rule.
 *
 * R2.4 renamed the field to `byDayOrdinals` and updated every consumer
 * (eventModalState, EventFormFields, RecurrenceFields, EventModal,
 * icalTypeMapping). This spec exercises the user-visible path:
 *
 *   1. Open a Tuesday day cell → modal opens pre-filled with Tuesday.
 *   2. Enable Recurring, pick Monthly, set pattern to "nth weekday",
 *      set nth to "Second".
 *   3. Save.
 *   4. Reload the page (forces the store to rehydrate from localStorage).
 *   5. Open the same event from the calendar.
 *   6. Assert the pattern, nth, and weekday are all preserved.
 *
 * If the bug were present, step 6 would fail because the in-memory
 * store would lose the ordinal across the save→reload round trip
 * (it would have been written to the wrong field, and the read path
 * would default to "First" + the start weekday).
 *
 * Conventions: see `e2e/__user-flow.template.ts` for the selector
 * hierarchy (data-component > aria-label > role+name > text).

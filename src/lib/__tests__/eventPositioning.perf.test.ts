/**
 * Performance regression guards for R4.2.
 *
 * The old implementation did an `Array.some` per column per event, then a
 * second O(n²) `filter`+`Math.max` sweep for `totalColumns`. The new
 * implementation uses an active-set sweep for placement and a tight
 * brute-force scan for `totalColumns`. On 30+ overlapping events the
 * difference is ~10x.
 *
 * These budgets are tight enough that the pre-R4.2 O(n²) algorithm fails
 * the smallest test on a typical dev machine — this is deliberate. An
 * accidental revert of the sweep-line (as happened during R4 code
 * review) should be caught immediately.

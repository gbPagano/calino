/**
 * Positions opaque events into columns.
 *
 * Transparent events are excluded from positioning and must be rendered
 * separately.
 *
 * Two-step algorithm (R4.2):
 *
 * 1. **Forward sweep** — places each event in the smallest free column among
 *    events currently overlapping it. The active set (events started but not
 *    yet ended) is maintained sorted by end-time, with `usedColumns` for
 *    O(1) membership lookups. Replaces the previous inner-`Array.some` loop
 *    that walked all previously-placed events for every column.
 *
 * 2. **Brute-force totalColumns** — for each event E, find the max column
 *    of any event that overlaps E. The semantic is "max columns used by any
 *    event in the same visual group as E", used by the layout to compute
 *    card width (`100 / totalColumns`). This is O(n) per event, O(n²)
 *    total, with a tight inner loop (no Map lookups, no `filter`+`max`
 *    allocation).
 *
 * Why a sweep plus a brute force, and not one clever pass:
 *   `totalColumns` for an event E is a function of events that may start
 *   *after* E (e.g. a long meeting that anchors a chain of shorter ones).
 *   No single forward/backward pass can compute it without lookahead, and
 *   a sweep-line data structure doesn't help — the brute-force scan is
 *   already small in practice (typical days have <50 events; even 1000
 *   events runs in well under 100ms). The placement sweep, which is on
 *   the same hot path, is where the algorithmic win lives.
 *
 * Complexity:
 *   - Sort: O(n log n)
 *   - Forward placement: O(n) per event (active-set scan + usedColumns loop),
 *     bounded by the size of the active set, which is usually << n.
 *   - totalColumns: O(n) per event, O(n²) total.
 *   - Total: O(n²), down from the previous O(n²) but with much tighter
 *     inner loops. Empirically ~10x faster for 30+ overlapping events.
